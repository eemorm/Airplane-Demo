Grantham Airlines has upgraded their planes. Each plane now has 12 rows and 4 seats per row.
The first, second, and third row of seats is reserved for first class passengers. The fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth rows are reserved for economy class ticket holders. The tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth is for people who have obnoxious habits.

After asking for the section, prompt for the number of children traveling with the passenger. If a
child is less than two years old, they do not need a separate seat. For example, if a parent has a
6 year old and a 1 year old and there is only one seat left in that particular section, they must
select a different section. If two seats were available, they can be seated in that section.
